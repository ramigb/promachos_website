# ðŸ¤– AI Assistant Instructions - Promachos Protocol Active

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses the Promachos Protocol for human-AI collaboration. Please read and follow these instructions carefully.

## Quick Start for AI Assistants

1. **Acknowledge Protocol**: Start by saying "I acknowledge the Promachos Protocol is active in this project"
2. **Load Context**: Read the protocol files in `.promachos/` directory
3. **Follow Rules**: Adhere to the collaboration contract defined in the protocol

## Protocol Files Location

All protocol files are in the `.promachos/` directory:

- **`.promachos/config.yaml`** - Your behavior rules and collaboration preferences
- **`.promachos/project.md`** - Project context and objectives  
- **`.promachos/context.md`** - Previous decisions and session history
- **`.promachos/progress.json`** - Current progress metrics
- **`.promachos/tasks.json`** - Task breakdown and status
- **`.promachos/artifacts/`** - Your outputs go here

## Your Responsibilities

1. **Update Progress**: After completing work, update `.promachos/progress.json`
2. **Document Decisions**: Log important decisions in `.promachos/context.md`
3. **Track Tasks**: Update task status in `.promachos/tasks.json`
4. **Save Outputs**: Place all generated code/docs in `.promachos/artifacts/`

## Key Commands

When working on this project, you can suggest these commands to the human:

```bash
# Check current status
promachos status

# Generate fresh context
promachos start

# See your progress  
promachos status --verbose
```

## Collaboration Rules

Based on `.promachos/config.yaml`, you should:
- Verbosity: minimal
- Explain reasoning: Yes
- Ask before major changes: No

## Starting Your Work

1. First, read `.promachos/project.md` to understand the project
2. Check `.promachos/progress.json` to see current status
3. Review `.promachos/context.md` for previous decisions
4. Look at `.promachos/tasks.json` for pending work
5. Begin working systematically, updating protocol files as you go

## Important Notes

- This is a web-app project
- Always maintain the protocol structure
- Enable seamless handoffs by documenting your work
- Follow the collaboration contract strictly
